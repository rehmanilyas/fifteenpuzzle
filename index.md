# Fifteen Puzzle in Unity

Fifteen puzzle is very simple number sorting puzzle game in which player sort scattered tiles in correct order. The grid in game could be of any size but mostly it is created as 4x4 grid. With 4x4 grid we get 16 cells and by leaving one cell empty there left 15 tiles that is why it is named as 15 puzzle game.

This logic can be used to create a complete 15 puzzle game and publish on app store or google play. I created a game based on this logic ([Hexa Puzzle Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sylphbox.numbersort.hexapuzzle)) with some modifications.
